## Methane Number according to EN16726 with MWM corrections as a VBA Function for Excel.  

- Optimization performed with a very, **very**, simple genetic algorithm.  
- While the AVL Method only consider components with less than 5C-. This method manages components with less than 7C-.  
- This algorithm is especially useful in Hidrogen mixtures.  

## The formula will have the following sintax.  

=MethaneNumberMWM(Methane,Ethane,Propane,iButane,nButane,ipentane,npentane,Hexanes,Nitrogen,CarbonDioxide,Hydrogen,CarbonMonoxide,Butadiene,Butylene,Ethylene,Propylene,HydrogenSulphide)

### All the components are requested in Volume Percent
